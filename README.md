# hacker-backer
A repo to test hackathon concepts.  No code yet, just [filing issues](https://github.com/Blackbaud-BobbyEarl/hacker-backer/issues) to keep track of things.  

**FYI** I know I signed up for the Hackathon with my personal account, but it's just too much of a pain to switch back & forth (or use custom URLs) on my machine to make them both work, so I'll probably stick with this account and just grant access to our repo when we start working.
